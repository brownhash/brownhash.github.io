            Cryptography : A word in Greek origin means “ Secret writing”<br><br>

            Cryptography (Basic definition)<br>
            It is the science and art of transforming messages to make them secure and immune to attacks.<br><br>

            Different types of Cryptography<br>
            • Symmetric Key Cryptography : Same key will be used for encryption & decryption.<br>
            • Asymmetric Key Cryptography: One key will be used for encryption and another key will be used for decryption.<br>

            Steganography : A word in Greek origin means “ Covered writing”<br><br>

            Steganography (Basic definition)<br>
            Steganography means concealing the message itself by covering it with something else.<br><br>

            Historical Use:<br>
            • Messages were carved on pieces of wood and later dipped on the wax to covered writing.<br>
            • Messages were written on the thin piece of silk and later swallowed by the messenger.<br>

        </div>
        <div class="uk-card-body">
            ITU-T recommends some security mechanisms to provide the various security services.<br>
            Encipherment: It can be used to provide confidentiality. It can also be used to complement other mechanisms. (Cryptography & Steganography)<br>
            Data Integrity: It appends a short check value created for the message to be transmitted.<br>
            Digital Signature: Sender can electronically sign the data and receiver can electronically verify the signature.<br>
            Authentication exchange: Two entities exchange some messages to prove their identity to each other.<br>
            Traffic Padding: It means inserting some bogus data into the data traffic to thwart traffic analysis.<br>
            Routing Control: Selecting and changing different available routes between the sender and the receiver.<br>
            Notarization: It means selecting a trusted third party to control the communication between two entities.<br>
            Access Control: It gives methods to prove that a user has access right to the data or resources of the system.<br>

        </div>
        <div class="uk-card-body">
            Passive attacks:<br>
            Attacker’s goal is to just obtain the information.<br>
            Attack dose not modify the data or harm the system.<br>
            Snooping: Unauthorized access to or interception of data.<br>
            Traffic analysis: Attempts of analyzing encrypted messages to come up with likely patterns.<br><br>

            Active attacks:<br>
            Attack may change the data or harm the system.<br>
            Modification: The attacker modifies the information.<br>
            Masquerading or Spoofing: It happens when the attacker is posing the identity of somebody else.<br><br>

            Replaying: The attacker obtains the copy of the message and later tries to replay it.<br>
            Repudiation: Sender denies that he has send the message or Receiver denies that he has received the message.<br>
            Denial of Service: It may slow down or totally interrupt the service of a system.<br>

            <h3>Kerckhoff’s Principle</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="uk-card-body">
            • It appears that a cipher is more secure if we hide both the encryption(E)/decryption(D) algorithm and the secret key.<br>
            • Based on the Kerckhoff’s principle, adversary always know the E/D algorithm.<br>
            • Resistance of the cipher to attack must be based on the secrecy of the key.<br>
            • Guessing of the key should be so difficult that there is no need to hide the E/D algorithm.<br>
            • For modern ciphers, it is require that there key domain should be very large.<br>

            Substitution & Transposition ciphers<br>

            • Substitution ciphers: We replace one symbol in the ciphertext with another symbol.<br>
            • Transposition ciphers: We reorder the position of symbols in the plaintext.<br><br>

            Substitution ciphers can be categorized to:<br>
            Mono-alphabetic & Poly-alphabetic ciphers.<br><br>

            • Mono-alphabetic: The relationship between a character in the plaintext to a character in the ciphertext is one to one.<br>
            The simplest mono-alphabetic cipher is the additive cipher. This cipher is sometimes called a shift cipher and sometimes a Caesar cipher(with key 3), but the term additive cipher better reveals its mathematical nature.<br><br>
            • Poly-alphabetic: The relationship between a character in the plaintext to a character in the ciphertext is one to many.<br>

        </div>
        <div class="uk-card-body">
            The secret key is made up of 25 characters arranged in 5x5 matrix. (I and J assumed same meaning).<br><br>

            Before encryption:<br>
            The entire message is divided into a pair of characters. If two letters in a pair are the same, a bogus letter is inserted to separate them. Finally number of characters should be even.<br><br>

            Encryption Rules:<br>
            • If two letters are in same row, encrypted letters are right to it.<br>
            • If two letters are in column, encrypted letter are beneath to it.<br>
            • If two letters are not in same row or column, the corresponding encrypted for each letter is in its row but in the same column as other.<br>
