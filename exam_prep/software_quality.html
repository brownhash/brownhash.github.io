            In general, people’s quality expectations for software systems they use and rely upon are two-fold:<br>
            1. The software systems must do what they are supposed to do. or They must do the right things.<br>
            2. They must perform these specific tasks correctly or satisfactorily. or They must do the things right.<br>

        <div class="uk-card-body">
            ISO-9126 (ISO, 2001) provides a hierarchical framework for quality definition, organized into quality characteristics and sub-characteristics. There are six top-level quality characteristics, with each associated with its own exclusive (non-overlapping) sub-characteristics.<br><br>

            Functionality: The range of operations that can be run on a system properly.
            Reliability:The ability of an apparatus, machine, or system to consistently perform its intended or required function or mission, on demand and without degradation or failure.<br>
            Usability: The extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a specified context of use.<br>
            Efficiency: Accomplishment of or ability to accomplish a job with a minimum expenditure of time and effort.<br>
            Maintainability: Maintainability is the ease with which a product can be maintained in order to correct defects or their cause, repair or replace faulty or worn-out components without having to replace.<br>
            Portability:Portability in high-level computer programming is the usability of the same software in different environments.<br>

            A defect rate is percentage of output that fails to meet a quality target. Defect Rate can be used to evaluate and control programs, projects, production, services and processes. Defect rate can be calculated by using following formula: R = (P / O) × 100 Where, R = Defect rate P = Defective products O = Total observed products

            <b>Interoperability:</b> It describes the ability of a service to communicate with other services and allow other services to communicate with it. It measures how freely information can be exchanged. Example:? Reliability:It reflects the ability of a service to operate correctly.<br>
            <b>Availability:</b> It is the ability of a service to answer to requests / be accessible. Usability: It measures the quality of user experience (UX) a service provides. It can be increased by having a UX focused development workflow. Security It has two major aspects: Confidentiality (access only granted to authorized users) and authenticity (trust the provided information).<br>
            <b>Performance:</b> It is a broad topic. In the context of services people often refer to response time or latency(the delay incurred in communicating a message) as a performance measure. Scalability: It describes the ability to deal with changes. Extensibility :It represents the ability to add functionality to a component without touching other components or parts of the system.<br>
            <b>Adaptability:</b> It influences how easy it is to change the system if requirements have changed. Testability: matters when it comes to building and automating tests of individual components, interactions between components, as well as the system as a whole. In addition to that it is also crucial to know how well these tests can detect errors.<br>
            <b>Auditability:</b> It captures the ability to perform audits of the system. Audits might be required for legal, security, or financial reasons, for example. Auditability is a tough goal as it requires all services involved in a process to be auditable. Observability expresses whether changes in a system are reflected, if possible, in a quantitative manner.<br>
            <b>Operability:</b> It is a measure of how well a software system works when operating. We say that a software system with good operability works well and is operable.

            The oldest and most influential formal method is the so-call axiomatic approach. A set of formal conditions describing the program state before the execution of a program is called its pre-conditions, and the set after program execution the post conditions. This approach verifies that a given program satisfies its prescribed pre and post-conditions.

        </div>
        <div class="uk-card-body">
            we need effective techniques to remove as many of the injected faults as possible under project constraints. Fault may be reduce by using following techniques: Inspection: Direct fault detection and removal Inspections are critical reading and analysis of software code or other software artifacts, such as designs, product specifications, test plans, etc. Inspections are typically conducted by multiple human inspectors, through some coordination process. Multiple inspection phases or sessions might be used.<br><br>
            <b>Testing:</b> Failure observation and fault removal Testing is one of the most important parts of QA and the most commonly performed QA activity. Testing involves the execution of software and the observation of the program behavior or outcome. If a failure is observed, the execution record is then analyzed to locate and fix the fault(s) that caused the failure. As a major part of this book, various issues related to testing.<br>

            <h3>DEFECT CONTAINMENT</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="uk-card-body">
            Because of the large size and high complexity of most software systems in use today, the above defect reduction activities can only reduce the number of faults to a fairly low level, but not completely eliminate them. For software systems where failure impact is substantial, such as many real-time control software sub-systems used in medical, nuclear, transportation, and other embedded systems, this low defect level and failure risk may still be inadequate. Some additional QA alternatives are needed. On the other hand, these few remaining faults may be triggered under rare conditions or unusual dynamic scenarios, making it unrealistic to attempt to generate the huge number of test cases to cover all these conditions or to perform exhaustive inspection based on all possible scenarios. Instead, some other means need to be used to prevent failures by breaking the causal relations between these faults and the resulting failures, thus “tolerating” these faults, or to contain the failures by reducing the resulting damage.

            • Process metrics can be used to improve software development and maintenance. Examples include the effectiveness of defect removal during development, the pattern of testing defect arrival, and the response time of the fix process.<br>
            • Project metrics describe the project characteristics and execution. Examples include the number of software developers, the staffing pattern over the life cycle of the software, cost, schedule, and productivity.<br>
