            <h3>Definition of Distributed Systems</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="uk-card-body">
            A distributed system consists of a collection of
            autonomous computers, connected through a
            network and distribution middleware, which
            enables computers to coordinate their activities
            and to share the resources of the system, so that
            users perceive the system as a single, integrated
            computing facility.

            <h3>Common Goals and properties of distributed systems</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="uk-card-body">
            A distributed system may have a common goal, such as solving a large computational
            problem.

            Alternatively, each computer may have its own user with individual needs, and the
            purpose of the distributed system is to coordinate the use of shared resources or
            provide communication services to the users.

            Other typical properties of distributed systems include the following:

            The system has to tolerate failures in individual computers.

            The structure of the system (network topology, network latency, number of computers)
            is not known in advance, the system may consist of different kinds of computers and
            network links, and the system may change during the execution of a distributed
            program.

            Each computer has only a limited, incomplete view of the system. Each computer may
            know only one part of the input.
