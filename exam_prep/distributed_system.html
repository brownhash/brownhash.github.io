            <h3>Definition of Distributed Systems</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="uk-card-body">
            A distributed system consists of a collection of
            autonomous computers, connected through a
            network and distribution middleware, which
            enables computers to coordinate their activities
            and to share the resources of the system, so that
            users perceive the system as a single, integrated
            computing facility.

            <h3>Common Goals and properties of distributed systems</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="uk-card-body">
            A distributed system may have a common goal, such as solving a large computational
            problem.

            Alternatively, each computer may have its own user with individual needs, and the
            purpose of the distributed system is to coordinate the use of shared resources or
            provide communication services to the users.

            Other typical properties of distributed systems include the following:

            The system has to tolerate failures in individual computers.

            The structure of the system (network topology, network latency, number of computers)
            is not known in advance, the system may consist of different kinds of computers and
            network links, and the system may change during the execution of a distributed
            program.

            Each computer has only a limited, incomplete view of the system. Each computer may
            know only one part of the input.

            <h3>Parallel and Distributed Computing</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="uk-card-body">
            In parallel computing, all
            processors may have access
            to a shared memory to
            exchange information
            between processors.

            <hr>

            In distributed computing,
            each processor has its own
            private memory (distributed
            memory). Information is
            exchanged by passing
            messages between the
            processors.

            the machines are autonomous; this means they are
            computers which, in principle, could work independently.

            <b>User Perception:</b>
            the distributed system is perceived as a single system
            solving a certain problem (even though, in reality, we have several computers
            placed in different locations).

            The distributed system has following characteristics:

            They do not have share memory or clock

            The computers communicate between themselves by the exchanging messages
            over a communication network

            Each computer has its own memory and operating system

            <h3>Advantages of Distributed Systems</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="uk-card-body">
            Performance:
            very often a collection of processors can provide higher   performance (and better price/performance ratio) than a Centralized computer.
            <hr>
            Distribution:
            many applications involve, by their nature, spatially separated machines banking, Commercial, automotive system).
            <hr>
            Reliability (fault tolerance):
            if some of the machines crash, the system can survive.
            <hr>
            Incremental growth:
            as requirements on processing power grow, new machines can be added incrementally.
            <hr>
            Sharing of data/resources:
            shared data is essential to many applications (banking,  computer supported
            Cooperative work, reservation systems)
            other resources can be also shared (e.g. expensive printers).
            <hr>
            Communication:
            facilitates human-to-human communication.

        </div>
        <div class="uk-card-body">
            Certain common characteristics can be used to assess distributed systems<br><br>
            • <b>Resource Sharing</b><br>
            Ability to use any hardware, software or data anywhere in the system.<br>

            Resource manager controls access, provides naming scheme and controls concurrency.<br>

            Resource sharing model (e.g. client/server or object-based) describing how<br>
            - resources are provided,<br>
            - they are used and<br>
            - provider and user interact with each other.<br><br>

            • <b>Openness</b><br>
            Openness is concerned with extensions and improvements of distributed systems.<br>

            Detailed interfaces of components need to be published.<br>
            New components have to be integrated with existing components.<br>

            Differences in data representation of interface types on different processors (of different vendors) have to be resolved.<br><br>

            • <b>Concurrency</b><br>

            Components in distributed systems are executed in concurrent processes.<br>

            Components access and update shared resources (e.g. variables, databases, device drivers).<br>

            Integrity of the system may be violated if concurrent updates are not coordinated.<br>
            - Lost updates<br>
            - Inconsistent analysis<br><br>

            • <b>Scalability</b><br>
            Adaption of distributed systems to<br>
            - accommodate more users<br>
            - respond faster (this is the hard one)<br>

            Usually done by adding more and/or faster processors.<br>

            Components should not need to be changed when increases scale of a system.<br>

            Design components to be scalable!<br><br>

            • <b>Fault Tolerance</b><br>
            Hardware, software and networks fail!<br>

            Distributed systems must maintain availability even at low levels of hardware/software/network reliability.<br>

            Fault tolerance is achieved by<br>
            - recovery<br>
            - redundancy<br><br>

            • <b>Transparency</b><br>
            Distributed systems should be perceived by users and application programmers as a whole rather than as a collection of cooperating components.<br>

            Transparency has different dimensions.<br>

            These represent various properties that distributed systems should have.<br><br>

            - <b>Access Transparency:</b> Local and remote resources are accessed using identical operations.<br>
            - <b>Location Transparency:</b> Users are unaware of the location of resources<br>
            - <b>Migration Transparency:</b> Resources can migrate without name change<br>
            - <b>Replication Transparency:</b> Users are unaware of the existence of multiple copies of resources<br>
            - <b>Failure Transparency:</b> Users are unaware of the failure of individual components<br>
            - <b>Concurrency Transparency:</b> Users are unaware of sharing resources with others<br>
            - <b>Performance transparency:</b> load variation should not lead to performance degradation. This could be achieved by automatic reconfiguration as response to changes of the load; it is difficult to achieve.<br>
            - <b>Relocation Transparency:</b> Hide that a resource may be moved to another location while in use (the others don’t notice).<br>
            - <b>Persistence Transparency:</b> Hide whether a (software) resource is in memory or on disk<br>

            <h3>Issues in distributed systems</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="uk-card-body">
            • <b>Global Knowledge</b><br>
            Due to the unavailability of global clock and shared memory and unpredictable message delay, it is impossible to to collect the upto date information about the global state<br><br>

            • <b>Naming</b><br>
            Names are used to refer the objects. A name  service map a logical name to the physical address by making use of lookup table<br><br>

            • <b>Scalability</b><br>
            Grow with time<br><br>

            • <b>Compatibility</b><br>
            Three level of compatibility exist in DS<br>
            - Binary level<br>
            - Execution level<br>
            - Protocol level<br><br>

            • <b>Process synchronization</b><br>
            The synchronization is DS is difficult because of the unavailable of shared memory
            Problem of mutual exclusion<br><br>

            • <b>Resource management</b><br>
            Resource management concern with both local and remote resources available to user in an effective manner<br><br>

            • <b>Security</b><br>
            Authentication and authorization<br><br>
