            <h3>Definition of Distributed Systems</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="uk-card-body">
            A distributed system consists of a collection of
            autonomous computers, connected through a
            network and distribution middleware, which
            enables computers to coordinate their activities
            and to share the resources of the system, so that
            users perceive the system as a single, integrated
            computing facility.

            <h3>Common Goals and properties of distributed systems</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="uk-card-body">
            A distributed system may have a common goal, such as solving a large computational
            problem.

            Alternatively, each computer may have its own user with individual needs, and the
            purpose of the distributed system is to coordinate the use of shared resources or
            provide communication services to the users.

            Other typical properties of distributed systems include the following:

            The system has to tolerate failures in individual computers.

            The structure of the system (network topology, network latency, number of computers)
            is not known in advance, the system may consist of different kinds of computers and
            network links, and the system may change during the execution of a distributed
            program.

            Each computer has only a limited, incomplete view of the system. Each computer may
            know only one part of the input.

            <h3>Parallel and Distributed Computing</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="uk-card-body">
            In parallel computing, all
            processors may have access
            to a shared memory to
            exchange information
            between processors.

            <hr>

            In distributed computing,
            each processor has its own
            private memory (distributed
            memory). Information is
            exchanged by passing
            messages between the
            processors.

            the machines are autonomous; this means they are
            computers which, in principle, could work independently.
            <hr>
            <b>User Perception:</b>
            the distributed system is perceived as a single system
            solving a certain problem (even though, in reality, we have several computers
            placed in different locations).

            The distributed system has following characteristics:

            They do not have share memory or clock

            The computers communicate between themselves by the exchanging messages
            over a communication network

            Each computer has its own memory and operating system

            <h3>Advantages of Distributed Systems</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="uk-card-body">
            Performance:
            very often a collection of processors can provide higher   performance (and better price/performance ratio) than a Centralized computer.
            <hr>
            Distribution:
            many applications involve, by their nature, spatially separated machines banking, Commercial, automotive system).
            <hr>
            Reliability (fault tolerance):
            if some of the machines crash, the system can survive.
            <hr>
            Incremental growth:
            as requirements on processing power grow, new machines can be added incrementally.
            <hr>
            Sharing of data/resources:
            shared data is essential to many applications (banking,  computer supported
            Cooperative work, reservation systems)
            other resources can be also shared (e.g. expensive printers).
            <hr>
            Communication:
            facilitates human-to-human communication.

            several problems are created by the network infrastructure, which have to be dealt with: loss of messages, overloading.

            Security problems
